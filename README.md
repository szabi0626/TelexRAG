# TelexRAG: Hungarian News Analysis System

> **System Overview**  
This notebook implements an intelligent research and analysis system designed for Hungarian news articles from [Telex.hu](https://telex.hu). It integrates **agentic workflows** to automate both search and reporting tasks.

The system consists of:

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent** — Automatically retrieves, analyzes, and summarizes relevant articles from Telex.hu.
2. **Visualization Agent** — Formats the analytical results into a clear and structured HTML report for easy consumption.

This agentic system leverages **LangChain’s StateGraph architecture** to modularize tasks and allow autonomous reasoning over Hungarian news data.
